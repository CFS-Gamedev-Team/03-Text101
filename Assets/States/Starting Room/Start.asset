  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers. At
    least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Could try punching my way through them.
    Or could sneak around the long way to the emergency exit.


    What should I do?

    1: Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2: Sneak my way to the emergency exit.'
